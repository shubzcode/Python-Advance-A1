Sure, here are some examples of Python programs that work with algorithms:

* **Sorting algorithms:**
    * Bubble sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
    * Selection sort: A sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and moves it to the sorted part.
    * Merge sort: A sorting algorithm that divides the array into two halves and recursively sorts the two halves.
    * Quicksort: A sorting algorithm that chooses a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot element.
* **Searching algorithms:**
    * Linear search: A searching algorithm that compares each element of the array with the target value and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target value.
    * Binary search: A searching algorithm that divides the array in half and recursively searches the half that contains the target value.
    * Jump search: A searching algorithm that jumps over a fixed number of elements in the array and then compares the target value with the next element.
    * Interpolation search: A searching algorithm that estimates the position of the target value in the array and then searches around that position.
* **Graph algorithms:**
    * Breadth-first search: A graph traversal algorithm that starts at a vertex and explores all of its neighbors before exploring any of their neighbors.
    * Depth-first search: A graph traversal algorithm that explores a vertex and then explores its neighbors in a recursive manner.
    * Dijkstra's algorithm: An algorithm for finding the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph.
    * Prim's algorithm: An algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph.

These are just a few examples of Python programs that work with algorithms. There are many other algorithms that can be implemented in Python.
